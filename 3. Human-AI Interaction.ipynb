    "**Background:**<br>\n",
    "Problems with the COMPAS case do not only arise from the software, but also with how judges use the software. With the analysis of task 1 and 2 in mind, you want to consult Northpointe and judges on how to effectively deploy the COMPAS risk scores for productive use. For this purpose you apply what you learned about human-AI interaction and cognitive biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**<br>\n",
    "As a showcase, you deploy your surrogate model and build a prototpyical interface that steers the human-AI interaction. The human-AI interaction should explicitly account for biases and limitations of your surrogate model as well as biases and limitations of judges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables:**<br>\n",
    "1. Briefly comment on general concerns you have with using recidivism prediction software in a legal system. Given COMPAS software is still in use in the US, what safeguards should there be to reduce ethical and societal risks?\n",
    "2. Create a web (`localhost`) interface that deploys your surrogate model and predicts a risk score for submitted defendant profiles.\n",
    "3. In bullet-points, sketch a human-AI interaction framework (not in code!) that explicitly accounts for the anticipated biases and limitations of both your surrogate model and the judges interacting with it. It must include a model prediction and a final decision, but you are free about the roles, sequences, explanations, visualizations etc.\n",
    "4. Discuss, how your design choices reduce the risks.\n",
    "5. Integrate **at least one** of your design choices in your deployed interface."
